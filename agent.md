# Agent Guidelines

This repository contains a Unity project for a shooter game. Follow these guidelines when contributing:

- Use four spaces for indentation. Match existing C# conventions using PascalCase for types and camelCase for variables.
- Each script file should declare a single class with the same name as the file.
- Place new scripts under `Assets/Scripts` in an appropriate subfolder.
- Keep changes focused and add comments explaining complex logic.
- There are no automated tests or build scripts. Validate your changes by opening the project in the Unity editor and checking for compile errors.
- Update `README.md` or docs when you introduce new systems or features.
