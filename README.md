# Shooter Game

This repository holds a Unity project for an experimental shooter game. The code and assets are under constant iteration, so expect the structure to evolve.

## Opening the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the folder with the Unity Hub or the Unity editor of your choice.

## Project Overview

The `Assets` directory contains all game assets and scripts:

- `Scripts` – C# code for gameplay systems like the player controller, weapons, and enemy AI.
- `Prefab` – prefabricated objects such as projectiles and pickups.
- `Scenes` – Unity scene files.

Other configuration is stored in `Packages` and `ProjectSettings`.

See `Docs/enemy_state_machine.md` for an in depth explanation of the enemy AI.
